# Numerical Methods Lab

This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical methods, including code and visualizations for common integration and curve fitting techniques. Each lab folder contains scripts for a specific numerical method, with interactive input and graphical output.


## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and `matplotlib` , `numpy` , `pandas` installed:
   ```sh
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install numpy
   pip install pandas
   ```
2. Run any script using:
   ```sh
   python <script_name.py>
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter data or function expressions as required.

## Features
- Interactive input for data points or function expressions.
- Visualizations of the numerical method and the area under the curve.
- Error handling for invalid input (e.g., interval requirements for Simpson's rules).

Developed for educational purposes in the Numerical Methods Lab.
